E-commerce website

In this project i used HTML,CSS,React-router-dom,React Context Api,material-UI and firebase.

I used firebase for Authentication and Hosting.
React-router-dom for navigating throught the multiple pages like signin-page, Home and Cart.

we added a basket functionality, using this you can add items to the cart and remove items 
from the cart and you can see the subtotal amount of the items that you've added to the cart.

you can check this out by clicking the link below.
